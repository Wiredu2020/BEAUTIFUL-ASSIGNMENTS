DATA DRIVEN OPTIMIZATION

Task One
Logistic Regression for Social Media Analysis
Logistic regression can be used to analyze advertising on social
networking platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
LinkedIn, etc. These platforms offer companies and advertisers
the opportunity to target specific demographic groups and user
segments based on their interests, demographics and online
behavior.
Logistic regression can be used for modeling to analyze the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and understand the factors that influence whether a user clicks on an ad or not. Based
on the results of logistic regression analysis, advertisers can
make data-driven decisions to improve their advertising campaigns on social media platforms.

Task Twon
Solar Radiation Assignment
. Neural-Network-Based Solar-Radiation Prediction
This part of the assignment uses the dataset SolarPrediction.csv
given from NASA. The task here is to predict Solar Radiation
level based on the given data. The dataset contains columns
as: "pressure", "wind direction", "wind speed", "humidity" and
"temperature". The response parameter that is to be predicted
is: "solar_radiation". The dataset contains measurements for
the past 4 months and you have to predict the level of solar
radiation.


NB: This assignment was completed under a tight deadline. Some of the methods used in my solution may not meet professional standards. I hope to enhance my skills and knowledge as a data scientist and contribute to projects aimed at solving real-world problems and making a positive impact on society.

Yours Regards
BNW!
